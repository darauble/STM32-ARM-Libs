This is a collection of various reusable libraries made for
use in STM32F103 projects. Can be easily be ported to other
Cortex-M3 ÂµCs from STM.

+ OneWire: a library to work with OneWire devices, utilizing
  U(S)ART as OneWire master. Planned to employ also a simple
  bitbanging mode and DMA for sending/reading OneWire bits.

+ schematics: various schematics from Eagle (with exported
  images for quick viewing):
