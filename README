This is a collection of various reusable libraries made for
use in STM32F103 projects. Can be easily be ported to other
Cortex-M3 µCs from STM.

+ DHT22

  A simple library to read DHT22 combined temperature/humidity
  sensor's data. Uses simple bitbanging and µs delays.

+ OneWire
  
  A library to work with OneWire devices, utilizing
  U(S)ART as OneWire master. Planned to employ also a simple
  bitbanging mode and DMA for sending/reading OneWire bits.

  Initial version of DS18B20 (and similar) sensors. Currently
  implemented only global start of conversion and reading of
  scratchpad for particular sensor.

+ schematics
  
  various schematics from Eagle (with exported
  images for quick viewing):
  -- ds18b20-stm32f103: how to connect DS18B20 temperature
     sensor to STM32F103 for usage with OneWire library

+ USART

  Utility library to print debugging strings to selected USART.
  Currently USART1, 2 and 3 are implemented.

+ Utils

  Several bare bones macroses to turn particular features on/off.

  Delay microseconds utility utilizing debuging registers.


Code samples for library use TBD.
