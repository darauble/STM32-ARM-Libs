/*
 * The header of the library to read Dallas temperature sensors. It uses
 * OneWire library, which provides core underlying protocol functionality.
 * Intended for use with SMT32 Cortex-M3 microcontrolers.
 *
 * LIBRARY IS DEPRECATED AND NOT SUPPORTED ANYMORE.
 *
 * TODO:
 * - implement writing to scratchpad (set alarm threshold, conversion resolution etc.)
 * - implement handling of different sensors
 *
 * dallas.h
